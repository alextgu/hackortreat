      "full_post_text": "Early in my career, my mentor asked me one simple question: 'What problem do you want to solve?' \n\nIt made me realize that focusing on tasks wonâ€™t drive growth â€” solving meaningful problems does. \n\nSince then, Iâ€™ve prioritized projects that challenge me and create impact. Itâ€™s led to faster promotions, stronger relationships, and more opportunities to learn.\n\nLesson: Donâ€™t chase titles â€” chase impact. And the rest follows naturally.\n\nðŸ’¡ If youâ€™re building your career, ask yourself the same question today.",

But after a month, I noticed a huge difference in output and clarity.\n\nBreaking tasks into dedicated blocks reduces decision fatigue and prevents context switching. \n\nI also schedule time for reflection â€” 15 minutes every evening to review progress and plan tomorrow.\n\nLesson: Structure isnâ€™t restricting â€” it amplifies creativity and focus. Try scheduling your day in blocks for one week and see the difference.",
